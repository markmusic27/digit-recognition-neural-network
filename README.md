_Note on accuracy:_ the ~90% accuracy score was computed by testing the model on images from the [MNIST database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) that had not been used in training (~10k of them). I've noticed user-generated images can differ significantly from what's found in MNIST, so the demo's accuracy _is likely worse (perhaps significantly)._

I built this as an exercise to learn more about the mathematical underpinnings of modern AI tech. Don't get me wrong: vanilla neural nets, and got forbid my implementation of them, are nowhere near "the latest in AI." But I found it to be a
